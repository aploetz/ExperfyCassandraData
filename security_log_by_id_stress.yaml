#Definitions for PRIMARY KEY columns
#PRIMARY KEY ((location, day_bucket), checkpoint_time, employee_id)
#
#For each column you can specify (note the defaults):
#
#Size distribution – Defines the distribution of sizes for text, blob, set and list types  (default of UNIFORM(4..8))
#Population distribution – Defines the distribution of unique values for the column values (default of UNIFORM(1..100B))
#Cluster distribution – Defines the  distribution for the number of clustering prefixes within a given partition (default of FIXED(1))
#
